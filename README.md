# Parallel and Distributed Computing Project

## Game of Life 3D

### Description

The life game is a zero-player game, that starts from an initial distribution of individuals in the game space. The game evolves by computing new generations of individuals based on simple rules.

### Rules

- a live cell with 4 or less live neighbors dies;

- a live cell with 5 to 13 live neighbors lives on to the next generation;

- a live cell with more than 13 live neighbors dies;

- a dead cell with 7 to 10 live neighbors becomes a live cell.

## Purpose of this project

The purpose of this project is to gain experience in parallel programming on shared and distributed memory systems, using OpenMP and MPI.
